# tentmap_plotter
Generate Plots of Tentmaps and Piecewise-Linear Maps in Python according to my Master's Thesis. The goal of this repo is to be able to estimate a distribution of data with a histogram distribution using the piecewise-linear and sawtooth/tentmap approach. 

# Piecewise-Linear Function
A piecewise-linear function is a from the interval $'[0,1]'$ to an interval $'[0,c]'$, where $c$ is any positive real number.

# Tentmap / Sawtooth Function
Tentmap functions and sawtooth functions are two names for the same thing. 

The file generate_hisogram_approximation.py contains the main functions.
